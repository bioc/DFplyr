Description: Provides `dplyr` verbs (`mutate`, `select`, `filter`, etc...) 
    supporting `S4Vectors::DataFrame` objects. Importantly, this is achieved 
    without conversion to an intermediate `tibble`. Adds grouping 
    infrastructure to `DataFrame` which is respected by the transformation 
    verbs.
